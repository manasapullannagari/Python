Why Numpy:
•	It is like python lists.
•	Many functionalities under the hood in NumPy are written in “c” that is fast. In ML we use a lot of computations, so we need to have any possible advantage in computational cost which is offered by NumPy.
•	The representation is in numbers, it is easy to understand by machines.
•	Backbone of all computation (numerical in python NUMPY)
•	It is the foundation of turning your data into a series of numbers on which Ml models try to find patterns.
•	If we use largescale numerical calculation, we refer to NumPy
•	Numpy avoids loops via broadcasting (applying any operation to all elements at a time) that avoids high computational time.
•	It is the backbone of other packages like pandas
